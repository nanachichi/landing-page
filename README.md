# landing-page

This is just a landing page.
For the theme I've chosen watermelons because I like them. Also Kherson :)
This project wasn't hard to accomplish.
Nevertheless, I learned a lot. For instance, I now know how to customize scroll bars through CSS and how to make buttons and links beautiful. Also I feel more comfortable in my flex usage skills.
I tried to make the design concise and pleasant to look at, as well as cute.
Thank you for viewing it!
